# Strategy
## Class with Useful Lectures
i.e. classes where lectures cover material
1. Take notes during lectures
1. Outside of class, transfer notes to interconnection
    - Helps memory by requring brain to restructure notes into a graph layout
### Class with Flipped Lectures
i.e. watch lectures or read textbook beforehand
1. Read textbook / watch lecture
2. Use summary and/or exercises to figure out what's important and tranfer to interconnection

# Tools
## Obsidian
The best note taking app. 
Allows you to use extended markdown syntax.
    Therefore files viewed on Github can be in rendered form
    Portable to other applications if Obsidian dies as an application
Obsidian Git exists to sync to a Github repo, allowing for seemingly infinite storage.
Support for code blocks
    Mermaid allows for basic diagrams and drawings.
Allows pasting of images.

# Languages / Syntax
## Markdown
Ubiquitous markup language.
Extended syntax support is sometimes a bit wonky and varies from application to application.
## Mermaid
Very well-supported syntax for diagrams and drawings.
Github supports rendering in their web view.
## Latex
Great language for creating resumes based on Jake's resume.
