# Quick Pizza

![Quick Pizza](/static/images/pizza.jfif)
This is a upgrade over my [Quick Flatbread](/blog/life/flatbread/) recipe. It's a yeastless "pizza" recipe.

## Ingredients

- (white) flour
- water
- salt
- (avocado) oil
- toppings

## Recipe

1. Turn oven on Broil.
1. Put (avocado) oil in a (cast iron) pan. Preheat to medium-high heat.
1. If there is a protein, one side of it in the pan.
1. In a regular bowl mix together: - (white) flour - water\
   until it's a mostly homogeneous. You want viscosity similar to that of pancake batter.
1. Shift the protein to the side, dump the flour mixture into the pan
1. Put the protein ontop of the flour mixture, such that its raw side is facing up
1. Add salt
1. Add the remaining toppings, some suggestions:
   - Mixed leafy greens
   - Cheese
   - Canned diced tomatoes or tomato sauce
   - Diced onions
   - Diced bell peppers
   - Diced mushrooms
   - Frozen vegetables
   - Dried herbs (e.g. oregano, basil, thyme)
