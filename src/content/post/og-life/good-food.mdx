# Good Food

My definition of good food requires at least two of the three criteria to be met:

1. [Cheap](#cheap)
2. [Tasty](#tasty)
3. [Healthy](#healthy)

## Cheap <a name="cheap"></a>

In both time and money. \
When eating out, consider wait time in line, wait time for food, and travel time. \
When cooking, consider the cost of ingredients, the time it takes to prepare them, and the time it takes for cleanup (i.e. return to original state).\

## Tasty <a name="tasty"></a>

Taste is subjective. \
Nonetheless:

- Oily food better be crispy
- Bland food better come with sauce/seasoning

## Healthy <a name="healthy"></a>

I'm no nutritionist, but I do know that I don't want to die young. Therefore I give at least a few shits about what I eat. \
Based on my limited knowledge, I think the following are healthy:

- unprocessed foods
- lower carb foods
- lower fat foods
- minimal added sugar

## Concluding throughts

- If I gotta have carbs, I prefer to eat them. Baked goods with a ton of white flour are ten times better than soda.
- Why is fruit so overpriced?
- Crisps are the best food that meet the cheap and tasty criteria.
