# Year 1: 2020-2021

Oh the joys of an online first year. Most memorable project is building a "claw" project that picked up soda cans. The "claw" contraption is controlled by a servo motor on a microcontroller. I call it a "claw" because it is actually a box, with a door -- this was crazy good for picking up heavy objects.

# Year 2: 2021-2022

Yay! I was able to get into computer engineering (CPEN). I think my average was around 90%, which was very similar to my high school average. Did I tell you I got waitlisted? Anyhow, second year is the most stressful courseload-wise. They gotta "catch you up", with regards to the other universities that don't have a general first year. I TA'ed for CPEN 211, and CPEN 212, notoriously challenging classes. Looking it from the instructor's view, I think the professors run it ok, especially Prof. Tor Aamdot -- he's got it running like clockwork.

UBC does a pretty good job of preparing you for the real world. You get exposure to digital design (CPEN 211), systems programming (CPEN 212), software engineering (CPEN 221), and data structures / algorithms (CPSC 221); all of which are great for the co-op hunt.

# Year 3: 2022-2023

Returning from the my co-op at [Brave Technology Coop](../projects/brave-coop.mdx), I realized hardware is hard! I decided to pivot my courses to be more on the software side. I took elective options in Machine Learning (CPSC 340), and Computer Vision (CPSC 425), which were excellent introductory courses to their respective fields. I was able to apply much of my linear algebra and calculus knowledge to both courses.

On the CPEN side, I took the Digital Design (CPEN 311), and Web Dev (CPEN 322). The digital design course has inspired my to create a [Python to Verilog transpiler](https://github.com/worldofkerry/tohdl). The web dev course went deep on the nitty gritty of javascript, particuarly on how it has evolved overtime.
