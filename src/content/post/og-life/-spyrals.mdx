# SPYRALs Archetype Guide

SPYRALs is a combo deck, aimed at getting out a bunch of materials to create powerful boards.

- Know one card in opponent's hand, and one card in their deck
- A trap set by Knightmare Gryphon and sent by Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion, usually a flood gate or hand rip
- Tri-gate wizard for omni-negate
- Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess for monster negates
- Necrovalley or Secret Village of the Spellcasters activated by Ancient Fairy Dragon
- Hand traps / spells drawn by Magician's Souls, Knightmare Griffin, etc.
