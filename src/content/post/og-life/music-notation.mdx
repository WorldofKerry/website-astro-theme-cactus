# Introduction

Since the summer, I've been trying to learn to play the Guitar. After practicing a fair share of Perfect, I've started to explore other songs. That's when [明天会更好](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8acxpIeJXQ)'s spicy tune hit me, and made me want to find out how to play it. I've found a few tabs online, but most of them were too difficult (I swear my fingers are too short). That's when I decided to just copy a piano sheet and try to change the key(?) to something that I can do fingerings for.

# The Conversion

I found a [明天会更好 piano sheet music](https://musescore.com/c_zhukov/scores/6364629) on Musescore[^1], and after browsing reddit for score generators, I was recommended Musescore 3[^1]. I recalled there being guitar tabs underneath the actual notes as well, when I used Musescore to learn [Perfect](https://musescore.com/user/6375061/scores/5380387), so I decided that it would be a good be the best choice. Given that Musescore requires a subscription to download the sheet music, I decided to manually copy the piano sheet music into Musescore 3.

[^1]: I will refer to the [Musescore website](https://musescore.com/) as Musescore, and the [Musescore 3](https://musescore.org/en/download) software as Musescore 3.

# Making it Playable for Me

Given my beginner level of guitar playing, I wanted to limit the fret positions to the first 4 frets. Playing around with the `ctrl+up` and `ctrl+down` shortcuts, I lowered most of the notes by an amount to satisfy the above condition. This resulted in the following sheet (although it does sound a bit off and is less upbeat than the original):

Nonetheless, I'm pretty happy with the result. Time to practice!
