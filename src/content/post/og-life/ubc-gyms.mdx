# Location Based Tips

- The bench presses at Birdcoops are pretty much never free, Arc is way better.
- Birdcoops are great for squats and deadlifts, there's 4 squat racks, 5 platforms vs 2 squat racks and 2 platforms at Arc.
- The cardio machines at Arc have much better airflow/fans.
- Birdcoop only has one cable row machine, Arc has 2 &mdash; time to do barbell rows instead.
- Leaving through the 'DOJO' exit at Birdcoop feels closer to Gage than the main exit.
- The fitness rooms at the residences are decently equiped for pull/leg exercises, I believe they all have cable machines as well.

# General Tips

- If one of the gyms is closed, the remaining open one will be packed to the
  brim.
- If you want to avoid lines on weekdays, try to go before 11 am or between 2-4 pm. - If you want to avoid lines on weekends, try to go before 12 am.
- If you're in for a quick workout, going 30 minbefore close on weekdays, allows you to get in on the equipment as people leave.
- Squats are op.

# ?????????? - Why do people use benches for hip thrusts when there's a machine for that? Or

is that called the glute bridge? Is there a benefit to using the bench?
