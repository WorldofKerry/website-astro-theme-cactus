# Advice

## Applications

- Apply for every position, even if you're not interested in it; you'll gain valueable experience if you get to do an interview with them (don't feel bad, as it's an opportunity for them to market the position to you as well, to make it more interesting to you)
- Minimize time spent writing cover letters, just ChatGPT them; even the APSC Coop ones do not read your cover letter
- There are browser extensions that will autofill your info onto applications and also complete the race, gender, disability, visa, etc. questions for you

## Interviews

- Have five or so experiences to discuss as answers to behavioral questions
- Know how to do leetcode easies under pressure (generally they'll help you with more difficult ones)
- Be able to explain your resume projects in detail (I forgot what I did for some of the earlier ones)
- Don't be afraid to ask for clarification on questions or help with technical questions, they've interviewed far more idiotic people than you, and the urge to learn is appreciated
- Know basic linux shell (perhaps play BashCrawl)
- For ASIC positions, actually review digital design, and not just review Verilog
- Know the basics of all popular programming languages (i.e. do a few leetcodes in each language); some positions require specific languages to be used for technical questions
- Have a solid scripted self-introduction prepared (i.e. what you've done, what you're interested in, what you want to do in the future)
