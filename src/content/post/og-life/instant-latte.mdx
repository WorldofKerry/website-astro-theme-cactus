# Instant Latte

## Ingredients

- Instant coffee
- Skim milk powder

## Recipe

Inside of a 20oz blender bottle, add:

- half a tablespoon of instant coffee
- a tablesppon of skim milk powder (I prefer skim milk as less fat $\implies$ easier to clean bottle)

Fill with cold tap water. Shake vigorously. Drink. \
Cheap, kinda tasty, no real health benefits.
