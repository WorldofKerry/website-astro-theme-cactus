# High School Arc

I first touched weights in grade 11 of high school. I think I was a bit overweight at the time. I took the weightlifting class because it's the most chill fitness class you can take. Honestly, I think I just trolled around. In grade 12, the teacher noticed, and gave me shitty mark, but alas we have to start somewhere.

Then COVID hit, and I don't think I exercised at all lol. Heck I don't think I even went outside. I did a bloodtest and was low on vitamin D in the summer...

# Residence Arc

In my second year at UBC, I lived in the Fairview residences. I went to the fitness room the Acadia Park commonsblock, as the legit gyms were pretty far away. I think I got some good gains.

In year three, I lived in Walter Gage. I recall mostly using the fitness room in the Pacific Residences.

# Calgary Arc

I think I got pretty hardcore when I moved to Calgary for my AMD internship. I didn't know anyone there, so I'd hit the gym every day(?) after work. They had a really sweet gym, with a smith machine where I did a lot of bench and squats. I recall watching lectures and being in calls on the treadmill. I also ran into my skip manager at the gym on a weekend. I only drank a protein shake in place of a lunch.

# Palo Alto Arc

This continued on with my internship at Tesla. They had a full gym as well. I bulked pretty hard on the free wasabi peas. There was also a fitness competition hosted by the Tesla Barbell Club. I was able to hit 185 bench, 225 squat, and 275 deadlift. Afterwards I started to train deadlift more (in addition to bench and squat).

# Birdcoop Arc Finale
April 16, 2025 marks the last day that I'll probably step foot in the Student Rec Center's Birdcoop gym. I did my maxes again. I was able to hit 225 squat for 3 reps, then hurt my lower back, but I think that was pretty close to my max. I also did 205 bench, and failed 225 (maybe I could'a done 215). I didn't do deadlifts due to the injury, but looking at my notes, I did do 295 before. Overall, pretty happy with results. I wish I could have tried a bit harder and gotten the sweet sweet 225 bench.
