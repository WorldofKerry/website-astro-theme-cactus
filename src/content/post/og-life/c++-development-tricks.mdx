# C++ Development Tricks

## VSCode: Compile Active File

If you have the CMake extension installed for VSCode and setup properly (e.g. connect to correct compiler toolchain), there is a command palette called `>CMake: Compile Active File`. If you run it with a C++ source file open, it'll run the compiler command for that specific source file, with all the arguments provided by CMake, allowing you to debug one file at a time.

With a bit of playing around, you may also be able to view the errors, error-by-error, using the "PROBLEMS" tab on the bottom (select it instead of "OUTPUT" or "TERMINAL").

## VSCode: Debugging with LLDB/GDB

Populating `./.vscode/launch.json` allows you to use the built-in debugging interface to debug code. This includes setting breakpoints in the source code using the VSCode window. Really handy once it's properly setup!
