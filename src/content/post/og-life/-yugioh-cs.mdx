## Spells

### Cast

Return one "Type" monster you control to your deck, then special summon one "Type" monster from your deck with a different name. If that monster is the same level as the monster you returned, draw a card, otherwise, add a "Segmentation Fault" or "Buffer Overflow" to your hand (at random).

### Operators

You can use the following effects of "Operators" once per turn, depending on the number of "Type" monsters you control.

1. Target one "Type" monster, increase its attack by 4000 and level by 4, but it cannot attack this turn.
2. Target a monster your opponent controls, set its attack to 0.
3. Tribute a "Type" monster, then special summon a "Type: Pointer" from your Extra Deck.
4. Tribute a "Type: Pointer", then special summon a "DS" monster from your Extra Deck.

### Binary Search

If all your opponents monsters have increasing ATK from the left to the right, or right to left, you can banish a card from your opponents hand, field and graveyard. Otherwise, your opponent chooses to banish one card from their field. If you control "Operators", draw a card.

### Recurse

Target 1 XYZ "DS" monster you control. Special summon "Type" monsters from your deck equal to the number of materials used to summon it. If you control "Operators", draw a card.

### Malloc

Equip to one Fusion, Synchro, or Xyz "DS" monster you control. If it leaves the field, special summon monsters from your graveyard so that the sum of their levels/ranks is equal to the level/rank of the monster you equipped this card to.

### Free

Target 1 "DS" monster in your graveyard. Draw cards equal to its level or rank divided by 4, rounded down, then shuffle it into your deck.

## Trap Cards

### Segmentation Fault

When a monster declares an attack, return all monsters on the field to the hand.

### Floating Point Error

When there's a battle involving a monster you control and a monster your opponent controls, flip a coin, if heads, your monster gains 1000 ATK. If you would lose from taking life point damage, banish this card, and if you do, end the turn-player's turn.

### Buffer Overflow

When a mosnter declares an attack, destroy all monsters on the field, then for each destroyed monster under your control, draw a card.
