# Books

I can't believe I started to read books. Excluding textbooks, the last time I read was probably in High School!

This whole reading thing started when I finished Uni and started my job. My job is remote. Therefore, there were days that I didn't leave the home at **all**.

I wanted to change that. And what better than a trip to the library?

Atomic Habits caught my eye in the Speed Reads section. That was the beginning.

You see, Atomic Habits is about forming habits. I figured reading was a good habit to start. Especially right before bed, to avoid all the blue-light from browsing my phone. This caused a feedback loop, where the more I read that book, the more I understood how to better my reading habit, causing me to pick it up again the next night.

Now I have a pretty steady read-before-bed habit before bedtime. I do so with a headlamp that produces red light (a Fenix HM50R I got during my biking days).

Unfortunately, there are days where I get completely hooked, and end up getting less than 6 hours of sleep ... tradeoffs.

## Atomic Habits

An excellent book to read! My biggest takeaway is that forming habits is all about consistency. Follow the author's rule to never skip a habit two days in a row. To build off of that, realize that even doing a "fraction" of a habit is still worthwhile. 

Just last night, I was finishing up Bad Blood and ended up only sleeping for ~5 hours. I snoozed my alarm 6 times (10 min each), from 6:20am till 7:20am. Now, I didn't go to the gym the day before, but didn't want to break this rule. So I still ended up going to the gym. Was only there for 23 minutes (did a set of squats and a set of pull ups), before running out of time. But nonetheless, I feel great today!

## Bad Blood

This is a book about the Silicon Valley bio-tech start-up Theranos did a lot of deceit. Eventually leading to the key executives being imprisoned for fraud.

There a series of questions that resonated with me, relating to investing in a company (Chapter 23: Damage Control, page 273-274)

- Why was the founder so secretive about her technology?
- Why did the founder never recruit a board member with even basic knowledge of their field?
- Why hadn't a single venture capital firm with expertise in their field put money into the company?

I think there was a lack of due diligence involved. Holmes was able to convince reputable people with her charm. Those reputable people provided reputability for the company for other reputable people. The cycle continued so far that even the vice president of USA gave a shout-out to Theranos. For it to all come crumpling down within a year.

I don't think I'm all that great in social contexts, and thus am looking to improve. Getting better at remembering people's names is a tip that I really want to get better at!
