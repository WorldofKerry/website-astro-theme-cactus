# Books

I can't believe I started to read books. Excluding textbooks, the last time I read was probably in High School!

This whole reading thing started when I finished Uni and started my job. My job is remote. Therefore, there were days that I didn't leave the home at **all**.

I wanted to change that. And what better than a trip to the library?

Atomic Habits caught my eye in the Speed Reads section. That was the beginning.

You see, Atomic Habits is about forming habits. I figured reading was a good habit to start. Especially right before bed, to avoid all the blue-light from browsing my phone. This caused a feedback loop, where the more I read that book, the more I understood how to better my reading habit, causing me to pick it up again the next night.

Now I have a pretty steady read-before-bed habit before bedtime. I do so with a headlamp that produces red light (a Fenix HM50R I got during my biking days).

Unfortunately, there are days where I get completely hooked, and end up getting less than 6 hours of sleep ... tradeoffs.
