# My greatest bike ride around Vancouver

> Taking a bike ride through vancouer has been an incredible eye-opening experience for me. Being able to utilizes your senses, without the barrier of a car's window allows one to really be more in touch with what the city has to offer. From my starting point near BNSS, the trans canada trail really shows how mountainous the terrain of the area is, there are hugely steep descents and painfully long stretches of climbing. As you pass by Iron Workers Bridge, you get a glimps of the lines of cars, in a endless flow, crossing over to the north shore. Just beyond that, through New Brighton Park, you may find countless people walking their dogs -- vancouverites really do love their dogs :3 Then after a short ride through a peaceful neighbourhood, you cross over the bridged portion of Powell, where a strong gasoline stench fills your nose, and the noisy vehicles that pass by you. Below the bridge, towards the inlet, you can see the ports that load up the lengthy trains that seemingly always arrive just in time to block your path between north and south Burnaby. Past that, you get to experience the more sketchy side of vancouver, comming across a couple of off-putting people from time to time. As you take the main street circular bridge across the rails and into the park trails, you pass by dozens of tents of homeless people -- so close, yet so far from the city core. Really makes you wonder how the quality of life in North America can be rated so high, yet the large gaps in our social classes are so apparent. As you take the Seabus bridge to reach Waterfront, you exit to see a downtown culture that is nothing like anywhere else in the mainland. Of course, the first thing you would also notice is the amount of litter that is now present. Then as you make your way to Stanley Park, you notice all the different people, using different modes of transportation to get around the Seawall, whether that is walking, running, ebiking, scootering or cycling. As you get more inside, you start to notice the "cyclist" on the side of the road, where the "normal" bikers stick to the Seawall in making their trips. This becomes more apparent as you reach Lions Gate Bridge, where "cyclists" would often take the steeper road over the bridge, where the "normies" would take the cramped route underneath the bridge -- both routes are terrific for getting view of west/north Vancouver.
