- Skiing (Trees are so scary)
- Snowboarding (kinda ass at it, falling on my ass too)

# Future

- Surfing (Tofino?)
- Bouldering
- Scuba Diving
- Kayaking (or packrafting type trip)
- Archery
- Golfing (only if I hit 5 mill net worth by 50)

# Past

- Badminton (2v2 is hype)
- Longboarding (had no helment to try tricks)
- Boxing (I got out-reached)
- Mountain Biking (I still have to try bike park)
- Cycling
- Running (I no longer run for the bus)
