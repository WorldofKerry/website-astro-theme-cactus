The best stirfry ingredients.

The most up-to-date list is at this for my stir-fry ingredient tier list is at this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xFM61IE504fLMbnKMD8gXjCEDEeez4mrK6NcqhnHvW4/edit?usp=sharing).

In general, I think a combination of

- crunch (think brocolli)
- umami (think mushrooms, soy sauce)
- protein
- non-green vegetable for colour

produces the best stirfry.

## Inspiration

If you scroll really far on [cookingspeedrun](https://www.instagram.com/cookingspeedrun/), there was a school term where I exclusively made stirfry-related dishes for lunch. I tried to time and take a picture of every single one of them.
