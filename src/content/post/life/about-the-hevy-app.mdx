I've been using [HEVY](https://www.hevyapp.com/) for a while now, have 32 workouts logged so far. Previously, I was just using Google Keep to log my workouts.

The app's great! I love the timer, fluid UI, workouts with images, support for lbs/kg. However, there's just a few things that could be improved:
- A way to combine kg and lbs weights in the same exercise. The gym I go to has both kg and lbs weights, as sometimes one kind runs out.
- Include fixed weight barbells as apart of the barbell exercises. E.g. if I do curls with a 50 lb fixed barbell, the app expects me to use a 45 lb bar plus 2.5 lb plates, which is a bit unintuitive.
- A way to show a history of an exercise while doing a new workout. Perhaps I can keep notes on why I did extraordinarily well or poorly on a certain day.
- A timer for the set during as well, to make sure I'm not taking too long to do the set after the rest timer is over, or taking too long of a break between reps.

I'm really considering building my own workout tracker app. However, syncing data (e.g. to Health Connect) seems quite challenging.

We'll see!
