An excellent book to read! My biggest takeaway is that forming habits is all about consistency. Follow the author's rule to never skip a habit two days in a row. To build off of that, realize that even doing a "fraction" of a habit is still worthwhile.

Just last night, I was finishing up Bad Blood and ended up only sleeping for ~5 hours. I snoozed my alarm 6 times (10 min each), from 6:20am till 7:20am. Now, I didn't go to the gym the day before, but didn't want to break this rule. So I still ended up going to the gym. Was only there for 23 minutes (did a set of squats and a set of pull ups), before running out of time. But nonetheless, I feel great today!
