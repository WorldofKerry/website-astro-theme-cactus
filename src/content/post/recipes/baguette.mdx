# Baguette

## Instructions

I quite like the ingredient ratios [by momsdish](https://momsdish.com/baguette). Mostly because I only have all-purpose flour, and do not have a scale to measure in grams. I have only tried with a smaller batch (all ingredients halved makes 4 baguettes).

My end goal is to be able to mimic a [French baguette](https://ca.gozney.com/cdn/shop/articles/Baguettes_Richard_Bertinet_-_Large1.jpg?v=1678459000), the more slender shape enables a higher surface area to volume ratio for more crispiness per bite.

For the techniques, I quite like methods show [in this video by John Kirkwood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m08i8oXpFB0), pay particular attention to:
- the folding (using wet hands)
- the forming (using flour dust)
- the scoring diagram (make sure to [cut sufficiently deep and at an angle](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/1754cs7/scoring_baguettes/))

For getting steam, like the boiling water in a pot, then transfer to pan in oven [used by Claire Saffitz here](https://youtu.be/bxXZVNc4SVw?si=EDs5JU3F25HXp3ui&t=1603).
