# Summary

Using a FPGA to draw a Reuleaux Triangle using VGA output

## Key Takeaways

- Used external IP (vga core adapter) for own design
- Output data externally

# Project Components

## Implemented Modules

- Bresenham circle algorithm
- Reuleauxtriangle algorithms by using the multiple instances of the circle algorithm with extra bounds
- Fillscreen with black pixels (to clear the screen)

HDL code can be provided upon request, due to course policies.

## Simulation

- Full testbenchs for all modules using ModelSim Altera

## Compilation

- Quartus Prime

## Hardware

- De1-SoC FPGA
- VGA-supported monitor

## Provided Modules

- VGA adapter core (converts framebuffer view to VGA output)

## Provided Information

- Pseudo-code for the algorithms

# Results

Able to draw the Reuleaux Triangle on a VGA monitor, such that the pixels mimiced what I ploted in Python.
