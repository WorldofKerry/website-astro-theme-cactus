# Summary

Using a FPGA to crack ARC4 encrypted ascii text

## Key Takeaways

- Using multiple on-chip memories
- Correct read-enable interface
- Concurrent modules with synchronous memories

# Project Components

## Implemented Modules

- ARC4 State Initilization (to setup memory)
- Key-Scheduling Algorithm (KSA)
- ARC4 Pseudo-Random Generation Algorithm (PRGA)
- ARC4 Cracker (tocrack encrypted text)
- Concurrent ARC4 Cracker (using two modifier cracker modules)

HDL code can be provided upon request, due to course policies.

## Simulation

- Full testbenchs for all modules using ModelSim Altera

## Compilation

- Quartus Prime

## Hardware

- De1-SoC FPGA

## IP Modules

- RAM 1-PORT (generated with Quartus Prime)

## Provided Information

- Pseudo-code for the algorithms

# Results

Was able to crack the encrypted text in a sane amount of time. The cracked text can then be extracted from the memory using the Intel FPGA Monitor.
