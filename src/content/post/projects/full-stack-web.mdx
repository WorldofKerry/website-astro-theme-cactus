# Summary

Learning full stack web development with the MERN stack.

## Key Takeaways

- Hosting React/Next.js blog/portfolio on Vercel
- Hosting Node.js/Express.js API on Replit, which is kept awake by an UptimeRobot that pings my personal website's api that in turn pings Replit (where my server is hosted), as UptimeRobot required a paid subscription to be able to ping Replit domains.
- Hosting simple file server with MongoDB on Atlas
