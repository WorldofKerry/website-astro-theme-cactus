## Important Post-Install Changes <a name="important-post-install-changes" />

### Swap File

[Tutorial](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1274118/why-lubuntu-20-04-is-running-slow-when-i-use-opera-or-libreoffice), avoid programs going unresponsive when RAM is about to be maxed.

### Wayland Firefox

[Tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/c8itj2/enabling_wayland_on_linux/), mainly for two finger swipe forward/back gesture.

### Clipboard history

#### Copyq (works for Ubuntu, not intuitive for Fedora)

[Tutorial](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1287410/is-there-a-default-clipboard-history-in-ubuntu-if-there-is-how-can-i-access-it), in particular, "I assigned the Super + V shortcut through Ubuntu's Settings -> Keyboard Shortcuts, adding a custom one that runs a command copyq menu that brings up the tray menu."

#### GPaste (works for Fedora)

Install using Software, then enable `Enable the gnome-shell extension` under in GPaste preferences app, then run `sudo dnf install gnome-shell-extension-gpaste` to the the hotkeys to work properly.

### Cloud Storage (Syncthing)

[Tutorial](https://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/ubuntu/syncthing-install-and-setup), peer-to-peer cloud storage.

### Tiling Window Manager (Pop Shell)

[Tutorial](https://support.system76.com/articles/pop-shell/), you might have to run the final commands in TTY. Setting `<Super> + <Space` to launcher is also convenient.

## Judging Other Distros <a name="judging-other-distros" />

### Pop!\_OS

#### Pros

- Auto-tiling is amazing

#### Cons

- Mouse disappearing after using touchpad is inconvenient
- No secure boot

### Linux Mint

#### Pros

- Synaptic and and software center feel better than Ubuntu defaults

#### Cons

- Doesn't support Pop Shell
  - I tried i3-vm, the learning curve is pretty cracked
  - I tried Krohnkite with KDE, hotkeys interferred with Mint and were less 'automatic' than Pop Shell's

### Fedora

#### Pros

- Best integration with pop shell so far

#### Cons

- CopyQ doesn't seem to work unless I switch to xorg, which breaks pop shell
