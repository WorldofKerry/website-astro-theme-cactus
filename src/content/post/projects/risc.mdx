# Summary

Implemented a 16-bit RISC computer, using custom assembly and machine code. Can read instructions/data to/from memory, and perform basic computations.

## Key Takeaways

- Modular Design
- I/O interface

# Project Components

## Implemented Modules

- Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU)
- Datapath (Uses the 'registers' and ALU to logic)
- CPU (Interface for datapath, state machine, memory, and I/O)
- Shifter (Shifts data by a given amount)
- Register File (Emulates registers in a CPU)
- State Machine (Controls instruction decode and datapath)
- Instruction Decoder (Decodes instructions)

HDL code can be provided upon request, due to course policies.

## Simulation

- Full testbenchs for all modules using ModelSim Altera

## Compilation

- Quartus Prime

## Hardware

- De1-SoC FPGA

## Provided Information

Diagrams of the CPU, state machine, datapath, and ALU
